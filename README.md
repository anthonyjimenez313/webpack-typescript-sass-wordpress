# Webpack + Typescript + Sass + Wordpress

A Wordpress starter theme powered by Webpack, Typescript, and Sass.

## Usage

1. Clone or copy the repository into your `wp-content/themes` folder
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Develop with `yarn dev`
4. Build for production with `yarn build`

A `build` directory is created with all of the deployable files. You should only upload `build` to the webserver - all other files can be ignored.
